# Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor

## Description
- My task was to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. It features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline. The application makes use of indexedDB as the database.
- The code uses HTML, CSS,and JavaScript for the front-end. 
- I received the starter code from [Xandromus](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/cautious-meme)
